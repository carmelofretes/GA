\chapter{CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK }

According to the exposed results, we can conclude that our algorithm
with ordering obtains better Pareto Fronts, with respect to the algorithm
without ordination. Likewise we conclude that if we give a treatment
to the table of requests, ordering them from highest to lowest, defined
by the highest possible cost of said request, and we divide the table
of requests into two groups, one group of seniors and another group
of random attendance we get better Pareto Fronts. 

As future work to develop we can mention several opportunities: study
the performance of other spectrum assignment algorithms, consider
other strategies of sorting the request to be served, extend this
approaches considering other issues as modulation level assignment
or coded assignment.
