ELASTIC OPTICAL NETWORKS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A network consists of the collection of nodes interconnected by links.
 These links require transmission equipment, while the nodes require switching
 equipment.
 The different developments and technological research have shown that optics
 is one of the best for signal transmission, since it can simultaneously
 amplify multiple wavelength signals in a ravaged fiber connection.
 Therefore, an optical network is not necessarily totally optical: the transmiss
ion is certainly optical, but the switching could be optical, electrical,
 or hybrid

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The need to give the network a greater capacity to adapt to transmission
 requirements, increase the capacity, performance of the central sections,
 as the demand for network traffic grows, the new paradigm that we call
 elastic optical networks is born.
 We can define the EON as an OTN (Optical Transport Network) where all the
 equipment and the control plane can handle optical channels of variable
 bandwidth and all the switching elements can support different granularities
 in the spectrum of the channels that transmit information.
 The traditional optical network based on WDM divides the spectrum into
 separate channels.
 The separation between adjacent channels is between 50 GHz and 100 GHz
 which is specified by the ITU 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "itu-t-694-1"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The separation between channels is very large and if each channel contains
 a low bandwidth used and there is no traffic in that free gap, much of
 the spectrum is wasted.
 In order to fully exploit a network, apart from making bandwidth more flexible,
 it is necessary to have a network architecture that allows the transmission
 of different signal formats for transmission.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EONs introduce fixed granularity into the bandwidth of the channels transported
 through the fiber.
 The ITU-T G.694.1, establishes a series of fixed spectral grids, which divide
 the optical spectrum between 1530-1565 nm, from the C band, ranging from
 12.5 GHz.
 (Giga Herz) to 100 GHz, where most used are those of 50 GHz and 100 GHz
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "itu-t-694-1"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The important change in the EON architecture is the replacement of the
 fixed grid (Fixed-grid) by a new flexible grid (Flexi-grid.) The ITU-T is
 focused on the revision of a G.694.1 standard 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

, for a division of the flexible optical spectrum called flexi-grid, for
 which the optical spectrum of the C band (1530-1565 nm) was defined, it
 is divided into FS (Frequency Slots) of fixed sizes of 6.25, 12.5, 25 and
 50 GHz 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "itut-flexigrid"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and in addition a central frequency (CF, Central Frequency) is assigned
 to each elastic optical path (EOP - Elastic Optical Path)
\begin_inset Foot

\end_inset

 that must coincide with the beginning or the end of these slots existing
 differences in a fixed grid scheme and a flexible grid scheme.
 In the case of the fixed grid scheme, we can observe the inefficient use
 of spectrum due to the fixed division that has the 50 GHz spectrum between
 each CF's.
 If we observe the scheme of flexible grids can be noticed the free spectrum
 obtained thanks to the fine granularity that it offers and that allows
 to assign in a flexible way only the required bandwidth.

 scheme.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of RSA in Elastic Optical Networks is similar to the problem
 of Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) in networks based on WDM.
 The difference between them is the ability to flexibly assign the frequency
 spectrum.
 The RSA is classified into two types: Online/Dynamic and Offline/Static
 traffic 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rsa:offline-online"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the case of the offline RSA problem, the list of all transmission requests
 is already entered as input, in order to proceed with the analysis and
 resolution with this input data.
 For the online RSA problem, the analysis and resolution is done as the
 requests arrive dynamically.
 In the first problem can be applied optimization strategies; while in second
 one heuristic is usually developed.

ROUTING SPECTRUM ALLOCATION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RSA problem can be addressed as routing resolution and spectrum allocation
 iterative 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Christodoulopoulos2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In this approach the RSA problem, the greatest difficulty emerge, is the
 large number of conditions that poses the problem.
 This introduces greater computational complexity when calculating the optimal
 path for each request, in turn optimizing the allocation of spectrum, which
 ultimately translates into very large computing times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RSA problem in elastic optical networks is equivalent to the problem
 RWA networks.
 The difference between these two technologies is the ability of the elastic
 networks to an assignment of flexible spectrum to meet the data rate requested,
 where a set of contiguous slots of the spectrum is assigned to a connection.
 The following restrictions are taken into account when calculating the
 routing and spectrum allocation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
• Spectrum Continuity.
 That means the same spectral allocation of resources on each link along
 a canal route.
 Restriction on WDM and EON.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
• Spectrum contiguity (or adjacency).
 The subcarriers are adjacent to each other on a channel.
 Restriction on EON.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
• Spectral Conflict.
 It is defined as spectrum allocation for non-overlapping of different channels
 on the same fiber.
 Restriction on WDM and EON.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Basically RSA algorithms are concerned to allocate a fraction of optical
 spectrum for each connection request subject to the above restrictions.
 We see an example in Figure

, as the constraints are met for a solution.
 A connection request from node 1 to node 4 that requires 2 adjoining slots
 to transmit data, we see the first figure in the 1-2-4 nodes, use the links
 1 and 4, there is 4 slots available in the link 1, but in the link 4 there
 is only one slot available, then this does not meet the condition of contiguity.
 The following figure shows the 1-2-3-4 node, use the links 1, 2 and 3,
 to establish a route.
 We see that in the three link's meet contiguity condition since the slots
 are they found together in three links.

RELATED WORK 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the RSA is considered a NP-Complete problem 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, it has been treated with several techniques, exact and heuristic, both
 for dynamic and static traffic.
 Among the exact techniques are the ILP, while among the heuristics are
 optimizations with Colony of Bees (BCO, Bee Colony Optimization)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Different ILP models for small instances and different heuristics for more
 real scenarios have been used successfully to solve the RSA problem.
 As an example we can mention in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "christodoulopoulos"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 an ILP model was proposed to minimize the use of the spectrum to serve
 a traffic matrix.
 The authors propose a method that divides the problem into two sub-problems,
 the first is the routing and the second is the spectrum assignment and
 solves them sequentially, using a route-based approach.
 They also propose a heuristic algorithm that serves the connections one-by-one
 sequentially.
 Then in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Christodoulopoulos2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the authors extend their previous results including consideration of modulatio
n level.
 With this new consideration, a new problem was defined teh routing, modulation
 level and spectrum assignment (RMLSA), being outside the scope of this
 work.
 Other problems such as 
\shape italic
Fragmentation Aware and Dynamic Traffic
\shape default
 are also not considered

.
 Another ILP formulation and the proof that the RSA problem is a NP-complete
 problem can be found in

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Zhang2012rsa:restricciones2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the differences between an ILP for RWA and for RSA are exposed, as well
 as an algorithm complexity analysis.
 In the same work two RSA algorithms are exposed.
 These have a better performance than the ILP in larger networks.
 With these two heuristic algorithms, the computational time was reduced,
 which is considered an improvement compared with the ILP, with which it
 differentiates in computation hours.

\begin_layout Standard
The work proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "moga-rsa-dao"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, presents the multi-objective RSA problem and its associated algorithm
 model.
 Each request has many possible routes, and in each routing it has several
 spectrum assignment options.
 The problem is to minimize the spectrum width to support all requests and
 minimize the overall cost of the spectrum in the link.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective function for the work proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "moga-rsa-dao"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 is as following: there are two objectives associated with each solution.
 The first objective 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

, is the width of the spectrum that indicates the maximum indexed slice
 used in the network.
 The second objective 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}$
\end_inset

 is the total cost of the spectrum link.
 Given a set of requests, the route and channel are calculated for each
 one.
 After attending each demand sequentially and without any sort of ordering,
 the spectrum availabilities vector of each link is updated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work it is developed multi-objective approach to calculate a Pareto
 front.
 This approach is an extension of the work presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "engopt"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 which has an approach based on weighted sum.
 In our work, as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "moga-rsa-dao"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 it has many possible routes, and in each routing it has several spectrum
 assignment options.
 The problem is to minimize the spectrum used and the overall cost of the
 link spectrum at the same time.
 The same objective function is taken from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "moga-rsa-dao"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and the requests are handled as follows: applications are ordered from
 highest to lowest, defined by the highest possible cost of said request,
 the first 30% of said list is attended in the first place, while the remaining
 70% is treated in a random manner, unlike 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 it is a random ordering.

PARETO FRONT CONCEPTS 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is said that the solutions of a problem with multiple objectives are
 optimal because no other solution is superior to them when all the objectives
 and restrictions are taken into account at the same time.
 It can be said that no objective can be improved without degrading the
 other objectives.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The set of optimal solutions is known as Pareto Optimal solutions, in which
 they have multiple objectives to meet and present conflicts when performing
 the simultaneous optimization of them.
 From this concept, it is established as a requirement to affirm that one
 situation is better than the other, which it does not diminish in anyone,
 but improve at one; that is to say that one situation will be better than
 another, only if in the new one it is possible to compensate the losses
 of all the injured parties.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "pareto_figure"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, you can see the optimal Pareto sets for different scenarios with two objective
s and for the same solution space.
 In any case, Pareto's optimum is always composed of solutions located at
 the edge of the feasible region of the solution space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pareto Dominance in a context of minimization says (Min-Min Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "pareto_figure"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

): that a solution 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{1}$
\end_inset

 dominates another solution 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{2}$
\end_inset

if the following conditions are met: 1) the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{1}$
\end_inset

 is not worse than 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{2}$
\end_inset

 in all the objectives.
 2) The solution 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{1}$
\end_inset

 is strictly better than 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{2}$
\end_inset

in at least one objective.
 In Multi-objective Optimization is seeking to calculate the set of non-dominate
 solutions on the edge of the feasible region.
