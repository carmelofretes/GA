\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The increase in network traffic and the need to increase the capacity and
 performance of the stretches of transport networks, born the interest in
 elastic networks.
 At present, the optical transport technology used in optical networks is
 Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM); this technology has the capacity
 to transport, route and assign (Routing Wavelength Assigment) multiple
 channels in a same fiber based on carriers of different wavelengths.
 This implies that channels with little demand than the maximum supported,
 underutilize resources.
 Therefore, the flexibility of the spectral grid would be the solution,
 allowing transmission, routing and allocation.
 (RSA - Rounting and Spectrum Allocation) of channels with variable bandwidth
 that adjust to the demand.
 In WDM networks, routing planning and wavelength allocation algorithms
 (RWA) search for a physical route through the network and assign a wavelength
 for transport, the selection of that wavelength is conditioned to be the
 same during the route of the physical route, this condition is called a
 condition of continuity.
 In the elastic optical networks, the algorithms of routing planning and
 spectrum allocation (RSA), apart from the aforementioned condition, there
 is a new condition, which is the condition of contiguity in the spectrum.
 This condition stipulates that the frequencies slots that occupy each channel
 must be together in the spectrum.
 The RSA problem can be attacked as routing and spectrum allocation together.
 With this approach to the RSA problem, the greatest difficulty that arises
 is the large number of conditions posed by the problem; a greater computational
 complexity is introduced when calculating the optimal path for each request
 while optimizing the spectrum allocation.
 The heuristic proposed in this paper is a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm
 that determines a set of optimal Pareto solutions that are not dominated
 with respect to the others for the RSA problem.
 The different tests performed with this algorithm show promising results
 with respect to the paper presented in [16].
