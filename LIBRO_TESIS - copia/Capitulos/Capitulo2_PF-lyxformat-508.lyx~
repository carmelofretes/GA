PARETO FRONT CONCEPTS 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we define the concept of dominance and Pareto front for
 multi-objective problem solutions.
 It is said that the solutions of a problem with multiple objectives are
 optimal because no other solution is superior to them when all the objectives
 and restrictions are taken into account at the same time.
 It can be said that no objective can be improved without degrading the
 other objectives.
 The set of optimal solutions is known as Pareto Optimal solutions, in which
 they have multiple objectives to meet and present conflicts when performing
 the simultaneous optimization of them.
 From this concept, it is established as a requirement to affirm that one
 situation is better than the other, which it does not diminish in anyone,
 but improve at one; that is to say that one situation will be better than
 another, only if in the new one it is possible to compensate the losses
 of all the injured parties.
 In Figure 2, you can see the optimal Pareto sets for different scenarios
 with two objectives and for the same solution space.
 In any case, Pareto's optimum is always composed of solutions located at
 the edge of the feasible region of the solution space.
 Pareto Dominance in a context of minimization says (Min-Min Figure 2):
 that a solution x1 dominates another solution x2 if the following conditions
 are met: 1) the solution x1 is not worse than x2 in all the objectives.
 2) The solution x1 is strictly better than x2 in at least one objective.
 In Multi-objective Optimization is seeking to calculate the set of non-dominate
 solutions on the edge of the feasible region.
