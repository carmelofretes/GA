ELASTIC OPTICAL NETWORKS 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A network consists of the collection of nodes interconnected by links.
 These links require transmission equipment, while the nodes require switching
 equipment.
 The different developments and technological research have shown that optics
 is one of the best for signal transmission, since it can simultaneously
 amplify multiple wavelength signals in a ravaged fiber connection.
 Therefore, an optical network is not necessarily totally optical: the transmiss
ion is certainly optical, but the switching could be optical, electrical,
 or hybrid [7].
 The need to give the network a greater capacity to adapt to the needs of
 transmission and increase the capacity and performance of the central sections
 and as the demand for network traffic grows, the new paradigm that we call
 elastic optical networks is born.
 We can define the EON as an OTN (Optical Transport Network) where all the
 equipment and the control plane can handle optical channels of variable
 bandwidth and all the switching elements can support different granularities
 in the spectrum of the channels that transmit information.
 The traditional optical network based on WDM divides the spectrum into
 separate channels.
 The separation between adjacent channels is between 50 GHz and 100 GHz
 which is specified by the ITU.
 The separation between channels is very large and if each channel contains
 a low bandwidth used and there is no traffic in that free gap, much of
 the spectrum is wasted.
 In order to fully exploit a network, apart from making bandwidth more flexible,
 it is necessary to have a network architecture that allows the transmission
 of different signal formats for transmission.
 EONs introduce fixed granularity into the bandwidth of the channels transported
 through the fiber.
 The ITU-T G.694.1, establishes a series of fixed spectral grids, which divide
 the optical spectrum between 1530-1565 nm, from the C band, ranging from
 12.5 GHz.
 (Giga Herz) to 100 GHz, where most used are those of 50 GHz and 100 GHz
 [11].
 The important change in the EON architecture is the replacement of the
 fixed grid (Fixed-grid) by a new flexible grid (Flexi-grid.) The ITU-T is
 focused on the revision of a G.694.1 standard [11], for a division of the
 flexible optical spectrum called flexi-grid, for which the optical spectrum
 of the C band (1530-1565 nm) was defined, which is divided into FS (Frequency
 Slots) of fixed sizes of 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 GHz [12] and in addition a
 central frequency (CF, Central Frequency) is assigned to each elastic optical
 path (EOP - Elastic Optical Path) that must coincide with the beginning
 or the end of these slots existing differences in a fixed grid scheme and
 a flexible grid scheme In the case of the fixed grid scheme, we can observe
 the inefficient use of spectrum due to the fixed division that has the
 50 GHz spectrum between each CF's, and if we observe the scheme of flexible
 grids can be noticed the free spectrum obtained thanks to the fine granularity
 that it offers and that allows to assign in a flexible way only the required
 bandwidth.

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of RSA in Elastic Optical Networks is similar to the problem
 of Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RSA) in networks based on WDM.
 The difference between them (RSA and RWA) is the ability to flexibly assign
 the frequency spectrum.
 The RSA is classified into two types: Online/Dynamic and Offline/ Static
 traffic.
 In the case of the offline RSA problem, the list of all transmission requests
 is already entered as input, in order to proceed with the analysis and
 resolution with this input data.
 For the RSA online problem, the analysis and resolution is done as the
 requests arrive dynamically.
 In the first problem are can be applied optimization strategies; while
 in second one are usually developed heuristics.
