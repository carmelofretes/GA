INTRODUCTION 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The emergence of the interest in elastic optical networks (EON) comes from
 the constant increase in network traffic and the need to increase the capacity
 and performance of the sections in the transmission networks.
 At present, the transport technology used in optical networks is wavelength
 multiplexing (WDM).
 This technology is capable of transporting multiple channels in the same
 fiber, based on carriers of different wavelengths.
 The implication of this technology is that channels that have a reduced
 demand to the maximum supported by the granularity imposed, underutilized
 resources; given this and because network traffic will be highly heterogeneous,
 the flexibility in the provision of optical network resources is a challenge.
 A major change in the architecture of EON is the replacement of the fixed
 grid with a new flexible grid.
 The ITU-T is working on the revision of a new G.694.1 standard [4].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The calculating of an elastic optical routing has two parts: (a) optical
 routing operations (R), where calculations of the route between the originating
 node and the destination are made through a network topology, and, (b)
 selection of spectral resources on optical fibers (spectrum assignment,
 SA).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In WDM networks, the algorithms for routing planning and wavelength assignment
 seek a physical route through the network and assign a wavelength for the
 transport of that channel.
 The selection of that wavelength is conditioned to be the same during the
 route of the physical route, so that in this way it is not necessary to
 use wavelength converters in any jump.
 This condition is called a continuity condition (continuity constraint).
 In EON, apart from this condition, there is a new condition that is that
 of contiguity in the spectrum (contiguity constraint).
 This last condition means that the frequencies slots that occupy the channel
 must be together in the spectrum.
 For that, the routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) problem is more challenge
 than routing in WDM networks and is the more important problem in EON managemen
t.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the resolution of the numerous problems that have multiple objectives,
 a good meta-heuristic for this type of problems are the evolutionary algorithms
 (EA - Evolutionary Algorithm).
 Traditional EAs are customized to adapt to multi-objective problems, through
 the use of specialized fitness functions and the introduction of methods
 to promote the diversity of the solution.
 There are general approaches to the optimization of multiple objectives.
 One is to combine the individual objective functions in a single compound
 function or move all, except one of them for the set of constraints.
 The next approach is to determine a whole set of optimal Pareto solutions
 or a representative subset.
 An optimal set of Pareto is a set of solutions that are not dominated with
 respect to the others [16].
 This last approach is more convenient for making decision over a set of
 trade-off best solution instead of two first approaches.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work, the main contribution is an approach based on a Multi-objective
 Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEA) for the RSA problem, in which it is determined
 that the proposed approach improves in terms of quality from the Pareto
 front to the work presented in [16].
 The MOEA optimizes: (a) the spectrum used, and (b) the total cost, subject
 to the constraints of continuity, contiguity, and spectrum conflict imposed
 by the EON layer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our work is organized in the following way; in section 2 is explained EON
 technologies concepts.
 In section 3, the Multi-objective Pareto Front and Dominance concepts are
 explained.
 In section 4, the main related works are discussed.
 In the next part (section 5), the RSA problem is posed, in section 6, the
 contribution based on MOEA is presented, while in section 7, the experimental
 environment are performed.
 Finally in section 8, conclusions and future works are given.
